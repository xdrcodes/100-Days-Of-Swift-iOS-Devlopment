//Copying objects
//The third difference between classes and structs is how they are copied. When you copy a struct, both the original and the copy are different things â€“ changing one wonâ€™t change the other. When you copy a class, both the original and the copy point to the same thing, so changing one does change the other.
//For example, here's a simple Singer class that has a name property with a default valueðŸ‘‡
class Singer {
    var name = "Taylor Swift"
}
//If we create an instance of that class and prints its name, we'll get "Taylor Swift".
var singer = Singer()
print(singer.name)
//Now let's create a second variable from the first one and change its nameðŸ‘‡
var singercopy = singer
singercopy.name = "Justin Bieber"
//Because of the way classes work, both singer and singerCopy point to the same object in memory, so when we print the singer name again we'll see "Justin Bieber".
print(singer.name)
//On the other hand, if Singer were a struct then we would get "Taylor Swift" printed a second timeðŸ‘‡
struct SINGER {
    var name = "Taylor Swift"
}
