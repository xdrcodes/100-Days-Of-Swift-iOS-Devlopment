//Variables: They can vary - you can change their values freely.

var greeting = "Hello, Playground!" // This creates a new variable called greeting, giving it the value "Hello, Playground!"

//Because greeting is a variable we can change it.

greeting = "How are you?" //We don't need var the second time because the variable has already been created - we're just changing it.
