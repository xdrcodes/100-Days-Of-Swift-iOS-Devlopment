//Type annotation - Swift assigns each variable and constant a type based on what value itâ€™s given when itâ€™s created. So, when you write code like this Swift can see it holds a string:

let str = "Hello, playground" //So, when you write code like this Swift can see it holds a string.

//Type inference: Swift is able to infer the type of something based on how you created it.

//If you want you can be explicit about the type of your data rather than relying on Swiftâ€™s type inference, like thisðŸ‘‡
let album: String = "AceView"
let year: Int = 2022 // Integers = Int
let pi: Double = 3.14
let AceViewCodes: Bool = true // Booleans = Bool
