//Default parameter
//The print() function prints something to the screen, but always adds a new line to the end of whatever you printed, so that multiple calls to print() donâ€™t all appear on the same line.

//You can change that behavior if you want, so you could use spaces rather than line breaks. Most of the time, though, folks want new lines, so print() has a terminator parameter that uses new line as its default value.

//You can give your own parameters a default value just by writing an = after its type followed by the default you want to give it. So, we could write a greet() function that can optionally print nice greetingsðŸ‘‡

func greet(_ person: String, nicely: Bool = true) {
    if nicely == true {
        print("Hello, \(person)!")
    } else {
        print("Oh no, it's \(person) again...")
    }
}
//That can be called in two ways:
greet("Taylor")
greet("Taylor", nicely: false)
