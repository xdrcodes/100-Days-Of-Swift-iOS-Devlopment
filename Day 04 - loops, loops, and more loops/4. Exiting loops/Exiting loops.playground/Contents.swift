//Exiting loops - You can exit a loop at any time using the break keyword. To try this out, let's start with a regular while loop that counts down for a rocket launchðŸ‘‡
var countDown = 10
while countDown >= 0 {
    print(countDown)
    countDown -= 1
}

print("Blast off!")

//In this case, the astronaut in command gets bored part - way through the countdown and decides to skip the remainder and launch straight awayðŸ‘‡
var CountDown = 10

while CountDown >= 0 {
    print(CountDown)
    CountDown -= 1
    
    if CountDown == 4 {
        print("I'm bored. Let's go now!")
        break
}

countDown -= 1
}

//With that change, as soon as CountDown reaches 4 the astronaut's message will be printed, and the rest of the loop gets skipped.
