//Skipping items
//As youâ€™ve seen, the break keyword exits a loop. But if you just want to skip the current item and continue on to the next one, you should use continue instead.

//To try this out, we can write a loop from 1 through 10, then use Swiftâ€™s remainder operator to skip any numbers that are oddðŸ‘‡
for i in 1...10 {
    if i % 2 == 1 {
        continue
    }
    
    print(i)
}

//Remember, the remainder operator figures out how many times 2 fits into each number in our loop, then returns whatever is left over. So, if 1 is left over, it means the number is odd, so we can use continue to skip it.
