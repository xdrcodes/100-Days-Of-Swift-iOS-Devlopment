//Lazy properties
//As a performance optimization, Swift lets you create some properties only when they are needed. As an example, consider this FamilyTree struct - it doesn't do much, but in theory creating a family tree for someone takes a long timeðŸ‘‡
struct FamilyTree {
    init() {
        print("Creating family tree!")
    }
}
//We might use that FamilyTree struct as a property inside a Person struct, like thisðŸ‘‡
struct Person {
    var name: String
    lazy var familyTree = FamilyTree()
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var ed = Person(name: "Ed")
//But what if we didn't always need the family tree for a particular person? If we add the lazy keyword to the familyTree property, then Swift will only creat the FamilyTree struct it's first accessedðŸ‘‡
//lazy var familyTree = FamilyTree()
//So, if you want to see the "Creating family tree!" message, you need to access the property at least onceðŸ‘‡
