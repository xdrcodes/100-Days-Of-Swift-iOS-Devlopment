//Static properties and methods
//All the properties and methods we've created so far have belonged to individual instances of structs, which means that if we had a Student struct we could creat several student instances each with their own properties and methodsðŸ‘‡

//You can also ask Swift to share specific properties and methods across all instances of the struct by declaring them as static.
//To try this out, weâ€™re going to add a static property to the Student struct to store how many students are in the class. Each time we create a new student, weâ€™ll add one to itðŸ‘‡

//Because the classSize property belongs to the struct itself rather than instance of the struct, we need to read it using Student.classSizeðŸ‘‡
