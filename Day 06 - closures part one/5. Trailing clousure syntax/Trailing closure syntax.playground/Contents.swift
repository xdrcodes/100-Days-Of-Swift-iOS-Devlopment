//Trailing closure syntax
//If the last parameter to a function is a closure, Swift lets you use special syntax called trailing closure syntax. Rather than pass in your closure as a parameter, you pass it directly after the function inside braces.

//To demonstrate this, hereâ€™s our travel() function again. It accepts an action closure so that it can be run between two print() callsðŸ‘‡
func travel(action: () -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action()
    print("I arrived!")
}
//Because its last parameter is a closure, we can call travel() using trailing closure syntax like this:
travel() {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}
//In fact, because there arenâ€™t any other parameters, we can eliminate the parentheses entirely:
travel {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}
//Trailing closure syntax is extremely common in Swift, so itâ€™s worth getting used to.
