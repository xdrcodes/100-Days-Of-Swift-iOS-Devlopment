//Sets - Sets are collections of values just like arrays, except they have two differences:
// 1) Items arenâ€™t stored in any order; they are stored in what is effectively a random order.
// 2) No item can appear twice in a set; all items must be unique.

//You can create sets directly from arrays, like thisðŸ‘‡
let sevenSisters = Set(["Meghalaya", "Mizoram", "Nagaland", "Anurachal Pradesh", "Assam", "Tripura", "Manipur"])
//When you look at the value of colors inside the playground output youâ€™ll see it doesnâ€™t match the order we used to create it. Itâ€™s not really a random order, itâ€™s just unordered â€“ Swift makes no guarantees about its order. Because they are unordered, you canâ€™t read values from a set using numerical positions like you can with arrays.

//If you try to insert a duplicate item into a set, the duplicates get ignored. For exampleðŸ‘‡
let dress = (["Shirt", "Trouser", "Shirt", "Jeans", "Top", "Skirt", "Frock", "Jeans"])
//The final colors set will still only include Shirt, Trouser, Jeans, Top, Skirt, Frock
