//Returning closures from functions
//In the same way that you can pass a closure to a function, you can get closures returned from a function too.

//The syntax for this is a bit confusing a first, because it uses -> twice: once to specify your function's return value, and a second time to specify your closure's return value

//To try this out, we're going to write a travel() function that accepts no parameters, but returns a closure. The closure that gets returned must be called with a string, and will return nothing

//Here's how that looks in SwiftðŸ‘‡
func travel() -> (String) -> Void {
    return {
        print("I'm going to \($0)")
    }
}
//We can now call travel() to get back that closure, then call it as a functionðŸ‘‡
let result = travel()
result("London")
//It's technically allowable - although really not recommended! - to call the return value from travel() directlyðŸ‘‡
let result2 = travel()("London")
