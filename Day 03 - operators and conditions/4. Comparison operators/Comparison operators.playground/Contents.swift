//Comparison operators - Swift has several has several operators that perform comparison, and these work more or less like you would expect in mathematics.
//Let’s start with a couple of example variables so we have something to work with👇
let firstScore = 6
let secondScore = 4

//There are two operators that check for equality: == checks two values are the same, and != (pronounced “not equals”) checks two values are not the same👇
firstScore == secondScore
firstScore != secondScore

//There are four operators for comparing whether one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another. These are just like in mathematics👇
firstScore < secondScore
firstScore >= secondScore
let math = 6 > 4

//Each of these also work with strings, because strings have a natural alphabetical order👇
"Subham" >= "Paul"
"Anurachal Pradesh" > "Meghalaya"
