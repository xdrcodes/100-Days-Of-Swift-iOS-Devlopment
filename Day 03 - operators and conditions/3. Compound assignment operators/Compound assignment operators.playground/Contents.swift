//Compound assignment operators - Swift has shorthand operators that combine one operator with an assignment, so you can change a variable in place. These look like the existing operators you know -, +, * and /, but they have an = on the end because they assign the result back to whatever variable you were using.

//For example, if someone scored 95 in an exam but needs to be penalized 5 points, you could write thisðŸ‘‡

var score = 95
score -= 5

//Similarly, you can add one string to another using +=

var quote = "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the "
quote += "Spaniards"
