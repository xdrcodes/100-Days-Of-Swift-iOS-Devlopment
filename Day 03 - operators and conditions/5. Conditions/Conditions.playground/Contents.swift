//Conditions - Now you know some operators you can write conditions using if statements. You give Swift a condition, and if that condition is true it will run code of your choosing.

//To try this out, I want to use a Swift function called print(): you run it with some text, and it will be printed out.

//We can use conditions to check for a winning Blackjack handðŸ‘‡

//The code inside the braces â€“ { and } â€“ will be run if the condition is true. If you want you can provide alternative code to run if the condition is false, using elseðŸ‘‡
if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
} else {
    print("Regular cards")
}

//You can also chain conditions together using else ifðŸ‘‡
