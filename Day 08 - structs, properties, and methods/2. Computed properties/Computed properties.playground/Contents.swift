//Computed properties
//We just created a Sport struct like thisðŸ‘‡
struct Sport {
    var name: String
}
//That has a name property that stores a String. These are called stored properties, because Swift has a different kind of property called a computed property - a property that runs code to figure out its value.

//We're going to add another stored property to the Sport struct, then a computed property. Here's how that looksðŸ‘‡
struct sport {
    var name: String
    var isOlympicSport: Bool
    
    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympicSport {
            return "\(name) is a olympic sport"
        } else {
            return "\(name) is not an olympic sport"
        }
    }
}
//As you can see, olympicStatus looks like a regular String, but it returns different values depending on the other properties.
//We can try it out by creating a new instance of Sport:
let chessBoxing = sport(name: "Chessboxing", isOlympicSport: false)
print(chessBoxing.olympicStatus)
